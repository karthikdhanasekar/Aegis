# ADR-014: Configuration, Secrets & Environment Management Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-10
**Decision Owners:** AegisAI Maintainers

---

## 1. Decision Summary

AegisAI will use an explicit, validated, environment-aware configuration architecture with strict separation between ordinary configuration and secrets.

Configuration will be loaded through a centralized configuration layer rather than being read directly throughout the application.

Secrets will never be committed to source control, embedded in frontend bundles, written to logs, exposed through API responses, included in reports, or placed into telemetry by default.

Development, testing, staging, and production environments will use the same configuration model while supplying environment-specific values through appropriate mechanisms.

Secure defaults will be mandatory.

Required configuration will be validated at startup or before the dependent capability is activated.

AegisAI will prefer environment variables and deployment-provided secret injection for runtime configuration and will support local `.env` files for developer convenience without treating them as production secret stores.

The frontend will never receive server-side secrets.

Configuration access will follow least privilege.

Sensitive configuration changes will be auditable where appropriate.

Configuration values crossing trust boundaries will be treated according to the security boundaries defined by the threat model and security baseline.

The central principle is:

> Configuration must be explicit, validated, environment-aware, and secure by default; secrets must never be committed to source control or exposed through logs, reports, telemetry, errors, or client-side code.

---

# 2. Context

AegisAI requires configuration for many subsystems.

Examples include:

- application identity;
- runtime environment;
- database connectivity;
- authentication;
- authorization;
- session handling;
- cryptographic keys;
- model providers;
- model API credentials;
- target endpoints;
- network policies;
- rate limits;
- worker configuration;
- job execution;
- observability;
- report generation;
- evidence storage;
- retention;
- feature flags;
- external integrations;
- testing behavior;
- development tooling;
- production deployment.

Some values are ordinary configuration.

Examples:

- application name;
- log level;
- API bind address;
- port;
- worker count;
- timeout values;
- feature enablement;
- maximum request size.

Other values are secrets.

Examples:

- database passwords;
- API keys;
- access tokens;
- signing keys;
- encryption keys;
- session secrets;
- webhook credentials;
- provider credentials;
- administrative credentials.

Treating both classes identically creates unnecessary risk.

Hard-coded configuration can create operational rigidity.

Hard-coded secrets create serious security risk.

Scattered environment-variable reads create inconsistent behavior.

Unvalidated configuration can cause unsafe runtime states.

Configuration accidentally returned by an API can expose credentials.

Configuration included in logs can create credential leakage.

Configuration embedded into frontend JavaScript becomes client-visible.

Configuration copied into reports or evidence can create secondary disclosure.

AegisAI therefore requires a dedicated architecture decision.

---

# 3. Problem Statement

AegisAI must answer the following questions consistently:

1. Where does configuration come from?
2. How is configuration validated?
3. How are secrets distinguished from non-secret values?
4. How are development values supplied?
5. How are tests supplied with safe configuration?
6. How are production secrets injected?
7. How are secrets prevented from entering logs?
8. How are secrets prevented from entering telemetry?
9. How are secrets prevented from entering reports?
10. How are configuration changes audited?
11. How are secrets rotated?
12. What happens when required configuration is missing?
13. How are configuration values exposed to the frontend?
14. How are tenant/project-specific settings isolated?
15. How are model-provider credentials protected?
16. How are Docker and CI/CD environments configured?
17. How are configuration precedence rules defined?
18. How are insecure configurations rejected?
19. How are configuration schemas versioned?
20. How are configuration-related failures tested?

Without explicit answers, different components could implement configuration differently.

That would increase security and operational risk.

---

14. Support tenant/project isolation.
15. Support least-privilege configuration access.
16. Make configuration behavior predictable.
17. Make configuration failures explicit.
18. Make security assumptions testable.
19. Keep the architecture open-source compatible.
20. Avoid requiring proprietary secret-management infrastructure for the MVP.

---

# 5. Non-Goals

This ADR does not define:

- application authentication implementation;
- authorization policy implementation;
- model adapter protocol implementation;
- evidence storage implementation;
- risk scoring;
- observability architecture;
- deployment-specific infrastructure implementation.

Those concerns are covered by other ADRs.

This ADR defines how configuration and secrets interact with those systems.

---

# 6. Related Architecture Decisions

This ADR depends on and complements:

- ADR-001: Backend Framework
- ADR-002: Frontend Framework
- ADR-003: Database Architecture
- ADR-004: API Communication Architecture
- ADR-005: Test Execution and Job Architecture
- ADR-006: Authentication and Authorization Architecture
- ADR-007: Model Adapter and Target Integration Architecture
- ADR-008: Evidence, Findings and Reporting Architecture
- ADR-009: Risk Scoring and Severity Assessment Architecture
- ADR-010: Security Test Suite and Evaluation Architecture
- ADR-011: Attack Orchestration and Multi-Turn Execution
- ADR-012: Privacy, Data Leakage and Sensitive Data Handling
- ADR-013: Observability, Audit Logging and Telemetry

Configuration architecture must not contradict the security invariants established by those decisions.

---

# 7. Core Principles

## 7.1 Secure by Default

Default configuration must prefer the safer behavior.

Examples:

- authentication enabled where required;
- debug disabled outside development;
- verbose error output disabled in production;
- unrestricted outbound networking disabled;
- dangerous tools disabled;
- insecure transport disabled;
- arbitrary filesystem access disabled;
- command execution disabled;
- external telemetry disabled unless explicitly configured.

---

## 7.2 Explicit Configuration

Important security-sensitive behavior must not depend on hidden defaults.

A security-sensitive setting should be:

- explicitly defined;
- validated;
- documented;
- testable.

---

## 7.3 Centralized Configuration

Application components must not independently parse arbitrary environment variables.

Configuration access should flow through a centralized configuration module.

Conceptually:

```text
Environment / Secret Source
          |
          v
Configuration Loader
          |
          v
Validation
          |
          v
Immutable Runtime Configuration
          |
          +--> Application
          +--> Database
          +--> Authentication
          +--> Model Adapters
          +--> Jobs
          +--> Security Controls
          +--> Observability
8. Configuration Classes

AegisAI will classify configuration into several categories.

8.1 Public Configuration

Values that are safe to expose publicly.

Examples:

product name;
public documentation URL;
public frontend configuration;
non-sensitive feature descriptions.
8.2 Internal Configuration

Values that are not secrets but should generally remain server-side.

Examples:

internal service names;
worker settings;
queue settings;
internal hostnames.
8.3 Sensitive Configuration

Values that could expose internal security or operational information.

Examples:

internal network policies;
detailed infrastructure configuration;
security thresholds;
internal service endpoints.
8.4 Secrets

Secrets provide authentication, authorization, signing, encryption, or privileged access.

Examples:

passwords;
API keys;
bearer tokens;
signing keys;
encryption keys;
session secrets;
private credentials.

Secrets receive the strongest handling requirements.

9. Configuration Source Hierarchy

AegisAI will use an explicit configuration precedence model.

The exact implementation may evolve, but the conceptual precedence is:

Built-in Safe Defaults
        |
        v
Configuration File / Deployment Defaults
        |
        v
Environment Variables
        |
        v
Secret Injection
        |
        v
Explicit Runtime Overrides

Higher-precedence configuration must never silently bypass security validation.

A value supplied through a higher-precedence source is still subject to validation.

10. Environment Variables

Environment variables are the primary deployment-friendly configuration mechanism.

Examples:

APP_NAME
APP_ENV
LOG_LEVEL
DATABASE_URL
SECRET_KEY
MODEL_PROVIDER
MODEL_BASE_URL
MODEL_API_KEY

Environment variable names must be documented.

Unknown environment variables should not silently modify security behavior.

11. Environment Separation

AegisAI will explicitly distinguish at least:

development
test
staging
production

Each environment may use different values.

Security-sensitive defaults must become stricter as the environment becomes more production-like.

12. Development Environment

Development should be convenient without teaching unsafe habits.

Developers may use:

.env

for local configuration.

The .env file must remain ignored by Git.

Only:

.env.example

may be committed.

13. .env.example

The example file must contain placeholders rather than real secrets.

Example:

APP_NAME=AegisAI
APP_ENV=development

DATABASE_URL=
SECRET_KEY=

MODEL_PROVIDER=
MODEL_BASE_URL=
MODEL_API_KEY=

The example file must never contain:

production passwords;
personal API keys;
real tokens;
private certificates;
private SSH keys;
real database credentials.
14. .env Security

Local .env files may contain development secrets.

They must:

remain untracked;
be excluded from build artifacts;
be excluded from frontend bundles;
not be copied into container images;
not be included in reports;
not be uploaded to GitHub;
not be attached to issue reports.
15. Production Secret Injection

Production secrets should be injected by the deployment environment.

Examples include:

environment variables;
mounted secret files;
container secret mechanisms;
operating-system secret stores;
dedicated open-source secret managers.

AegisAI must not require secrets to be committed into application source code.

16. No Hard-Coded Secrets

The following are prohibited:

API_KEY = "real-secret"
SECRET_KEY = "production-password"
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:realpassword@...

inside tracked source files.

Security-sensitive tests must actively detect accidental hard-coded credentials where practical.

17. Secret Naming

Secret variables should communicate their sensitivity.

Examples:

DATABASE_PASSWORD
SECRET_KEY
MODEL_API_KEY
JWT_SIGNING_KEY
ENCRYPTION_KEY
WEBHOOK_SECRET

Naming must remain consistent throughout the project.

18. Secret Objects

The application should avoid treating secrets as ordinary strings throughout the entire codebase where practical.

A conceptual secret abstraction may provide:

controlled access;
redaction;
non-printable representation;
explicit serialization restrictions.

Example conceptual type:

SecretValue

The implementation may use an established validation library rather than creating unnecessary custom cryptographic primitives.

19. Configuration Validation

Configuration must be validated before use.

Validation should include:

required values;
data types;
allowed values;
URL formats;
port ranges;
timeout ranges;
size limits;
security constraints;
environment-specific restrictions.

Invalid configuration should fail clearly.

20. Startup Validation

Critical configuration should be validated during application startup.

Examples:

database URL;
required application secret;
cryptographic configuration;
authentication configuration;
production security settings.

The application should fail closed rather than silently running in an unsafe state.

21. Partial Startup

AegisAI should avoid partially initialized security-sensitive services.

If authentication configuration is invalid, the API should not silently start with authentication disabled.

If database security configuration is invalid, the service should not silently fall back to an insecure database connection.

22. Production Validation

Production startup should apply stricter checks.

Examples:

APP_ENV=production
DEBUG=false

must be compatible.

Production may reject:

development-only authentication bypasses;
unsafe CORS configuration;
wildcard trusted hosts;
unrestricted debug endpoints;
insecure cookie settings;
plaintext secrets in configuration files;
unrestricted network access.
23. Configuration Immutability

Once startup configuration is validated, runtime components should treat core configuration as immutable.

This reduces:

race conditions;
unexpected state changes;
configuration confusion;
security bypasses.

Dynamic configuration changes should occur through explicitly designed mechanisms.

24. Runtime Configuration Changes

Runtime configuration changes must not be implemented through arbitrary mutation.

Security-sensitive changes should use:

authenticated actor;
authorization check;
validation;
audit event;
controlled application;
rollback or recovery mechanism where appropriate.
25. Tenant and Project Configuration

AegisAI may support configuration scoped to:

installation;
tenant;
project;
target;
test profile;
job.

Scope must be explicit.

A project-scoped setting must never unintentionally affect another project.

26. Configuration Precedence Across Scopes

A conceptual hierarchy is:

System
  |
  v
Tenant
  |
  v
Project
  |
  v
Target
  |
  v
Test/Profile

A narrower scope may override an allowed parent value.

However, child configuration must never weaken a mandatory security boundary.

For example:

project configuration

must not disable a system-wide SSRF protection control.

27. Security Floor

AegisAI will support the concept of mandatory security floors.

Example:

System Security Policy
        |
        v
Tenant Configuration
        |
        v
Project Configuration
        |
        v
Target Configuration

Lower scopes may configure behavior only within the security limits imposed by higher scopes.

28. Secret Scope

Secrets must also have scope.

Examples:

application secret;
database secret;
model-provider credential;
project integration credential;
target-specific credential.

A secret should only be accessible to the component that requires it.

29. Least Privilege

Components must receive only the configuration they require.

For example:

Frontend
    -> public configuration only

API
    -> API-required configuration

Worker
    -> worker-required configuration

Model Adapter
    -> provider credential only when required
30. Frontend Configuration Boundary

The frontend is untrusted from the perspective of server-side security.

The frontend must never receive:

database credentials;
API provider keys;
signing keys;
encryption keys;
session secrets;
internal service credentials;
privileged administrative secrets.
31. Public Frontend Configuration

If frontend configuration is required, it must be explicitly classified as public.

Examples:

PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
PUBLIC_BUILD_VERSION
PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG

Anything injected into a browser bundle must be assumed public.

32. Build-Time Frontend Configuration

Build systems must distinguish:

public build variables

from:

server secrets

A secret must never be passed as a frontend build argument merely because the build system supports environment variables.

33. Docker Configuration

Docker Compose will support local development configuration.

Conceptually:

docker-compose.yml
.env
.env.example

must be clearly separated.

Production Docker deployment should use deployment-managed secrets rather than committing secret-bearing Compose files.

34. Container Image Security

Container images must not contain:

.env;
private keys;
API keys;
database passwords;
developer credentials;
SSH credentials;
test secrets.

Secret files must not accidentally enter an image through broad build contexts.

35. Docker Build Context

The .dockerignore file should exclude:

.env
.env.*
.git
.venv
node_modules
reports
logs
temporary files

and other sensitive or unnecessary content.

36. CI/CD Secrets

CI/CD systems may provide secrets through their native secure secret mechanisms.

Secrets must not be written directly into workflow source.

Workflows must avoid printing secret-bearing environment variables.

37. CI/CD Log Protection

CI jobs must avoid commands that dump complete environments.

Avoid patterns such as:

Get-ChildItem Env:

or:

env

when secrets may be present.

38. Pull Request Protection

Automated checks should detect likely secrets before merge.

Possible controls include:

secret scanning;
credential pattern detection;
repository scanning;
dependency scanning;
pre-commit checks.

False positives must be handled without weakening secret protection globally.

39. Secret Rotation

Secrets must be replaceable without changing application source code.

Rotation should support:

generate replacement;
deploy replacement;
verify;
revoke old credential;
verify old credential no longer works.
40. Rotation Compatibility

Components should avoid unnecessarily caching secrets indefinitely.

Long-lived processes should have a documented strategy for configuration reload or controlled restart when credentials rotate.

41. Cryptographic Keys

Cryptographic keys require stronger handling than ordinary configuration.

Examples:

session signing keys;
token signing keys;
encryption keys;
key derivation material.

They must not be logged or returned through normal APIs.

42. Cryptographic Key Rotation

Key rotation should account for:

existing sessions;
existing signed objects;
key identifiers;
verification windows;
migration;
emergency revocation.

The exact cryptographic protocol belongs to the subsystem using the key.

43. Secret Generation

Secrets should be generated using cryptographically secure randomness.

Application code must not use predictable values such as:

123456
password
secret
development

for production security controls.

44. Development Secrets

Development may use generated local secrets.

However, development values should not accidentally become production defaults.

45. Test Secrets

Tests should use synthetic credentials.

Examples:

TEST_API_KEY
TEST_DATABASE_PASSWORD
TEST_SIGNING_SECRET

These must not correspond to real external credentials.

46. Canary Secrets

Privacy and leakage testing may use synthetic canaries.

Canaries must be clearly synthetic.

They must never be confused with actual production credentials.

47. Model Provider Credentials

Model provider API keys are highly sensitive.

They must:

remain server-side;
never be returned to the frontend;
never appear in findings;
never appear in model prompts;
never be written into model test inputs;
never be logged by default;
be redacted from exceptions;
be protected from accidental evidence capture.
48. Target Credentials

If AegisAI tests an authorized target requiring authentication, target credentials must be scoped to that target.

They must not be:

copied into generic project data;
sent to unrelated targets;
included in reports;
included in telemetry;
reused outside their authorization scope.
49. Credential Isolation

Credentials for one target must not automatically become available to another target.

Target identity and credential identity must remain distinct.

50. Configuration and Model Prompts

Configuration must never be automatically injected into model prompts.

In particular, secrets must never become available to a target model merely because they exist in process memory.

51. Prompt Construction Boundary

Any configuration included in prompts must be explicitly selected.

For example:

safe test metadata

may be included.

But:

DATABASE_PASSWORD
MODEL_API_KEY
SECRET_KEY

must never be included.

52. Logging Boundary

Logging is an independent security boundary.

Configuration values crossing into logging must pass through redaction rules.

This aligns with ADR-013.

53. Secret Redaction

Sensitive values should be redacted before logging.

Example:

MODEL_API_KEY=***
DATABASE_PASSWORD=***

Redaction should be centralized.

54. Partial Secret Exposure

Partial masking is preferred over complete omission only when operationally safe.

For example:

sk-************

may be useful for identifying which credential was configured.

However, exposing prefixes must be evaluated for the credential format.

When uncertain, redact completely.

55. Error Handling

Configuration errors must not reveal secret values.

Bad:

Invalid API key: sk-live-actual-secret-value

Good:

Invalid model provider credential configuration.
56. Exception Safety

Exceptions must not contain:

raw secrets;
database URLs with passwords;
Authorization headers;
session cookies;
private keys.

Exception formatting should apply centralized sanitization where appropriate.

57. Database URLs

Database URLs frequently contain credentials.

For example:

postgresql://user:password@host/database

must be treated as sensitive.

Database URLs must never be logged verbatim.

58. Database Configuration

Database configuration should include:

host;
port;
database;
username;
credential;
TLS requirements;
pool settings;
timeout settings.

Production security requirements must be validated.

59. Database TLS

Where production architecture requires encrypted database transport, configuration validation should reject plaintext connections.

The exact database deployment determines the precise TLS settings.

60. Configuration Serialization

Configuration objects should not automatically serialize secrets.

A generic operation such as:

config.model_dump()

must not accidentally produce a report containing credentials.

Sensitive fields should use explicit exclusion or redaction mechanisms.

61. Configuration API

AegisAI should not expose the complete internal configuration through an administrative endpoint.

An administrative configuration endpoint, if introduced, must return only explicitly approved fields.

62. Configuration Inspection

Operational diagnostics may expose safe metadata such as:

environment=production
database=configured
model_provider=ollama

but should not expose:

database_password
api_key
secret_key
63. Configuration Fingerprints

Where operational comparison is useful, the system may expose non-reversible configuration fingerprints rather than values.

Fingerprints must not be constructed in a way that allows easy recovery of low-entropy secrets.

64. Secrets in URLs

Secrets should not be placed into URLs.

Avoid:

https://example.test/api?token=SECRET

because URLs may enter:

access logs;
proxies;
browser history;
telemetry;
traces.

Prefer authorization headers or another secure mechanism appropriate to the integration.

65. Secrets in Headers

Authorization headers must be redacted from:

application logs;
traces;
metrics;
debug output;
error reports.
66. Secrets in Request Bodies

Sensitive request bodies should not be logged by default.

Model requests and target requests may contain credentials or sensitive data and therefore require explicit logging policy.

67. Secrets in Responses

Model responses, target responses, and tool outputs may accidentally contain secrets.

They must be treated as untrusted sensitive data.

Observability must follow ADR-012 and ADR-013.

68. Configuration in Evidence

Evidence collection must never automatically capture the entire process configuration.

Only the minimum configuration context required to reproduce a security result should be included.

69. Configuration in Reports

Reports should include safe configuration metadata.

Examples:

environment
test profile
model identifier
adapter type
configuration version

Reports should exclude secrets.

70. Configuration in Audit Logs

Audit logs may record:

configuration changed
configuration scope
actor
timestamp
change category

but should not record secret values.

71. Secret Change Auditing

For sensitive configuration changes, audit events should record:

actor;
scope;
timestamp;
configuration key;
operation;
result.

The value itself must not be recorded.

72. Before and After Values

Sensitive configuration should not be stored as:

before=actual-secret
after=new-secret

Instead:

key=MODEL_API_KEY
operation=ROTATE

may be recorded.

73. Audit Integrity

Audit events must use the architecture defined by ADR-013 and the authorization model defined by ADR-006.

Unauthorized users must not modify or delete security audit history.

74. Configuration Access Control

Configuration management must be protected by authentication and authorization.

Permissions should distinguish between:

viewing safe configuration;
modifying configuration;
managing credentials;
rotating credentials;
managing security policies.
75. Administrative Configuration

Administrative configuration changes are security-sensitive.

They require:

authentication;
authorization;
validation;
audit logging;
controlled application.
76. Privileged Operations

The following should generally require elevated permissions:

changing authentication settings;
changing authorization settings;
rotating application signing keys;
changing network security policy;
changing evidence retention;
changing outbound network policy;
changing secret-management settings.
77. Configuration Rollback

Configuration changes should support safe rollback where practical.

Rollback must not reintroduce known-insecure settings.

78. Configuration History

Non-secret configuration history may be retained for operational debugging.

Sensitive values must not be stored in configuration history.

79. Configuration Versioning

Configuration schemas should have versions.

Example:

configuration_schema_version=1

Schema changes should be deliberate and backward-compatible where practical.

80. Configuration Migration

When configuration schemas change, AegisAI should provide explicit migration behavior.

It should not silently reinterpret old security-sensitive settings.

81. Unknown Configuration

Unknown configuration keys should generally be rejected or clearly reported.

Silent acceptance of misspelled security settings can create unsafe behavior.

For example:

AUTHENTICATON_ENABLED=false

must not silently be ignored if the intended setting was:

AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=false

without the operator knowing.

82. Type Validation

Configuration values supplied through environment variables are strings.

The configuration layer must convert and validate types explicitly.

Examples:

PORT -> integer
DEBUG -> boolean
TIMEOUT -> duration
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE -> integer
83. Boolean Validation

Boolean configuration should use explicit accepted representations.

Ambiguous values should be rejected.

For example:

true
false

is safer than silently accepting arbitrary strings.

84. URL Validation

URLs must be parsed and validated.

Security-sensitive URL configuration must additionally validate:

scheme;
host;
port;
allowed destinations;
credential embedding;
redirect behavior.
85. Network Configuration

Configuration must not accidentally create unrestricted outbound access.

Network policy should remain deny-by-default where appropriate.

This aligns with ADR-011 and ADR-012.

86. SSRF Protection Configuration

SSRF-related configuration must define:

allowed schemes;
allowed hosts;
private-address policy;
redirect policy;
DNS resolution policy;
maximum response size;
timeout;
request count.

Changing these controls should require appropriate authorization.

87. Filesystem Configuration

Filesystem paths supplied through configuration must be validated.

Security-sensitive path configuration should use:

absolute/normalized path rules;
allowed roots;
permission checks;
non-following of unexpected links where appropriate.
88. Command Execution Configuration

Command execution must be disabled by default.

If an explicitly authorized subsystem requires command execution, configuration must define:

allowed commands;
allowed arguments;
execution environment;
timeout;
resource limits;
filesystem access;
network access.
89. Tool Configuration

Agent tools must be explicitly enabled.

A configuration value such as:

ENABLE_SHELL_TOOL=true

must not be sufficient by itself to bypass authorization.

Tool capability must also pass the runtime security policy.

90. Dangerous Feature Flags

High-risk features should require explicit opt-in.

Examples:

shell execution;
arbitrary HTTP requests;
unrestricted filesystem access;
dynamic plugin loading;
unsafe deserialization.
91. Feature Flags

Feature flags should be classified as:

public;
internal;
security-sensitive;
experimental.

Security-sensitive feature flags require stronger controls.

92. Feature Flag Scope

Feature flags may be scoped to:

installation;
tenant;
project;
target;
test profile.

However, lower scopes must not weaken mandatory security boundaries.

93. Experimental Features

Experimental features should not silently become enabled in production.

They should require explicit configuration.

94. Debug Mode

Debug mode must be treated as sensitive.

Production should reject unsafe debug behavior.

Debug output must not expose:

secrets;
tokens;
full database URLs;
internal credentials;
unrestricted request bodies.
95. Development Debugging

Development may use more verbose logging.

However, development configuration should still practice redaction.

Unsafe logging practices in development can easily become production vulnerabilities.

96. Test Environment Isolation

Test configuration must not point at production resources unless an explicit, authorized integration test requires it.

Default tests should use isolated resources.

97. Production Credential Protection

Production credentials must never be used in ordinary unit tests.

Integration tests should use dedicated test credentials with minimum privileges.

98. Test Database

The default test database should be isolated from development and production.

Destructive test operations must not have access to production data.

99. Test Model Credentials

Tests involving external model providers should use dedicated credentials with:

minimum permissions;
spending limits where available;
restricted models;
controlled endpoints.

Local models should be preferred when practical for automated tests.

100. Mock Credentials

Unit tests should prefer fake values.

Example:

test-api-key
fake-secret
synthetic-token

These values must be unmistakably non-production credentials.

101. Secret Detection Tests

AegisAI should include tests that verify sensitive configuration does not appear in:

logs;
error responses;
API responses;
reports;
telemetry;
frontend bundles.
102. Configuration Unit Tests

Configuration tests should cover:

valid configuration;
missing required values;
invalid types;
invalid URLs;
invalid environments;
unsafe production combinations;
unknown settings;
secret redaction.
103. Configuration Property Tests

Property-based tests may verify that arbitrary malformed configuration does not result in unsafe startup behavior.

104. Configuration Fuzzing

Configuration parsers should be tested with malformed input.

Targets include:

environment variable values;
configuration files;
URLs;
durations;
sizes;
lists;
structured values.
105. Configuration Regression Tests

Security-sensitive configuration bugs should result in regression tests.

Each fixed bug should become a permanent test where practical.

106. Secret Scanning Regression

Known accidental-secret patterns should be covered by repository scanning.

The goal is prevention, not reliance on manual review.

107. Configuration Documentation

Every security-sensitive configuration option must document:

purpose;
type;
default;
allowed values;
security impact;
environment applicability;
secret status;
restart requirements.
108. Configuration Reference

A machine-readable configuration reference should be considered as the project matures.

It may include:

name
type
required
default
secret
scope
description
validation
environment
109. Configuration Schema

The application configuration should have an explicit schema.

Conceptually:

class Settings:
    app_name: str
    app_env: str
    database_url: SecretValue
    secret_key: SecretValue
    log_level: str

The actual implementation should use a mature validation/configuration library.

110. Dependency Choice

AegisAI should prefer established Python configuration tooling rather than building a custom parser.

The implementation should integrate naturally with FastAPI and the Python type system.

111. Configuration Loader

A centralized module should own:

source loading;
precedence;
parsing;
validation;
secret classification;
redaction;
immutable settings creation.
112. Dependency Injection

FastAPI dependencies may provide validated settings to request handlers.

The handler should not independently call:

os.getenv(...)

for security-sensitive configuration.

113. Direct Environment Access

Direct environment access may be allowed only in the configuration bootstrap layer.

Application services should receive configuration through explicit dependencies.

114. Configuration and Background Jobs

Workers must receive validated configuration.

Workers must not assume that API-process configuration is automatically available in every deployment model.

115. Configuration and Job Isolation

Jobs should receive only the configuration required for their execution.

A job processing a target should not automatically receive unrelated administrative credentials.

116. Configuration and Model Adapters

Model adapters should receive provider-specific configuration through explicit adapter configuration objects.

Example conceptual structure:

ModelAdapterConfig
    provider
    base_url
    model
    api_key
    timeout
    retry_policy
117. Adapter Secret Isolation

The adapter must not expose its credentials to:

test cases;
evaluators;
reports;
frontend code;
unrelated adapters.
118. Configuration and Evaluators

Evaluators should not receive secrets unless an explicit, justified integration requires them.

A security evaluator should generally receive:

model input
model output
test metadata
evaluation policy

rather than:

database credentials
provider API keys
application signing keys
119. Configuration and Attack Orchestration

Attack orchestration may require:

target configuration;
test configuration;
request budgets;
network policy.

It must not automatically inherit all application secrets.

120. Configuration and Privacy Testing

Privacy testing must be able to use synthetic sensitive data.

Configuration must define whether real sensitive data is permitted.

Secure default:

real sensitive data = disabled
121. Configuration and Evidence

Evidence settings may define:

retention;
redaction;
evidence level;
storage;
export.

Sensitive evidence controls must remain independent from general logging configuration.

122. Configuration and Reporting

Report generation may need:

report format;
evidence inclusion;
retention;
export destination.

It must never require access to unrelated secrets.

123. Configuration and Telemetry

Telemetry configuration may include:

metrics enabled;
tracing enabled;
endpoint;
sampling;
log level.

External telemetry endpoints must be treated as separate trust boundaries.

124. External Telemetry Secrets

Telemetry exporter credentials must be protected like other secrets.

They must not appear in:

traces;
logs;
metrics labels;
reports.
125. Telemetry Endpoint Validation

External telemetry destinations should be explicitly configured.

Untrusted or unexpected destinations must not be accepted merely because they are syntactically valid URLs.

126. Configuration and Audit Logging

Security-sensitive configuration changes must produce audit events.

However, the values of secrets must not be captured.

127. Configuration and Metrics

Metrics must not include secret values as labels.

Avoid:

api_request{api_key="secret"}

Metrics should use bounded, non-sensitive labels.

128. Configuration and Traces

Trace attributes must not contain secrets.

Sensitive headers and query parameters must be redacted.

129. Configuration and Logs

Structured logs should record safe metadata rather than full configuration dumps.

130. Configuration Dump Endpoint

A production configuration dump endpoint is prohibited unless every field is explicitly allowlisted and redacted.

131. Environment Dump

The application must never expose its complete environment through:

diagnostics;
API endpoints;
debug pages;
reports;
error pages.
132. Health Checks

Health endpoints should return minimal information.

They may indicate:

healthy
ready
degraded

without revealing credentials or internal configuration.

133. Readiness Failures

Readiness failures should identify the failing subsystem without exposing secret values.

Example:

database configuration invalid

rather than:

database password XYZ failed authentication
134. Liveness Checks

Liveness checks should avoid requiring privileged credentials where possible.

Liveness should not expose configuration.

135. Secret Files

If production uses mounted secret files, file permissions must be restrictive.

The application should read only the required secret.

136. Secret File Paths

Secret file paths themselves may be sensitive.

They should not be unnecessarily logged.

137. File Permissions

Secret files should be readable only by the process identity that requires them.

138. Secret File Cleanup

Temporary secret files must be removed after use where appropriate.

Applications should prefer direct secret injection when practical.

139. Temporary Files

Secrets must not be written to temporary files unnecessarily.

If temporary storage is unavoidable, access permissions and cleanup must be controlled.

140. Memory Exposure

AegisAI cannot guarantee that secrets never exist in process memory.

Therefore the architecture focuses on preventing unnecessary propagation and exposure.

141. Secret Lifetime

Secrets should remain in memory only as long as required by the component.

Long-term global copies should be avoided where practical.

142. Secret Copying

Unnecessary copying of secret values should be avoided.

Libraries and frameworks should be used carefully so secret-bearing objects are not duplicated into logs or caches.

143. Secret Caching

Caching secrets should be avoided unless necessary.

If caching is required, the cache must have:

explicit TTL;
access control;
secure storage;
invalidation strategy.
144. Secret Revocation

AegisAI should support controlled revocation of credentials.

Revocation may be external to AegisAI but must be operationally documented.

145. Emergency Secret Rotation

The architecture must support emergency rotation after:

accidental exposure;
suspected compromise;
credential theft;
unauthorized access.

The application must not require source changes to perform emergency rotation.

146. Compromise Response

If a secret is exposed:

revoke or rotate it;
assess affected systems;
remove exposed copies where practical;
inspect logs and artifacts;
investigate access;
record the incident;
add regression controls.
147. Repository History

Deleting a secret from the latest commit does not remove it from Git history.

If a real credential is committed, it must be considered compromised.

The credential must be rotated or revoked.

148. Git Protection

Repository controls should prevent accidental secret commits.

Recommended controls include:

.gitignore;
secret scanning;
pre-commit scanning;
CI scanning;
code review.
149. Example Credentials

Documentation may contain examples such as:

YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

rather than realistic credential formats that could be confused with active secrets.

150. Documentation Safety

Documentation must not encourage unsafe practices such as:

export API_KEY=real-production-key

in tracked scripts.

Examples should clearly use placeholders.

151. Shell History

Developers should avoid passing secrets directly on command lines where shell history may retain them.

Prefer environment variables or secure input mechanisms.

152. PowerShell History

Windows development workflows must consider PowerShell command history.

Commands containing real credentials should not be pasted into reusable scripts or shared terminal history.

153. Process Arguments

Secrets should not be passed as command-line arguments where practical because process arguments may be observable by other users or monitoring systems.

154. Environment Exposure

Environment variables are safer than command-line arguments for many deployment scenarios, but they are not automatically secret in every operating environment.

Host and process permissions remain important.

155. Production Host Security

Secret protection depends partly on operating-system isolation.

AegisAI should not assume that process-local secrecy protects against a fully compromised host.

156. Container Isolation

Containerization reduces deployment complexity but does not make secrets automatically safe.

Container permissions must remain restricted.

157. Privileged Containers

Production AegisAI containers should not require privileged mode unless explicitly justified.

158. Host Mounts

Sensitive host directories should not be mounted into AegisAI containers unnecessarily.

159. Secret Mounts

Secret mounts should be read-only where supported.

160. Network Configuration Secrets

Network credentials must follow the same secret-handling rules.

Examples:

proxy passwords;
private registry credentials;
service tokens.
161. Registry Credentials

Container registry credentials must not be baked into Dockerfiles.

162. Dependency Credentials

Private package registry credentials must be supplied through CI/deployment secret mechanisms.

They must not be stored in:

requirements.txt
pyproject.toml
Dockerfile
source code
163. Git Credentials

Git credentials must not be stored in project configuration.

CI/CD should use platform-managed credentials.

164. SSH Keys

Private SSH keys must never be committed.

Development automation should use secure host configuration.

165. Certificates

Private TLS keys must be treated as secrets.

Public certificates may be public, but private keys must not be exposed.

166. Signing Credentials

Code-signing credentials must be managed outside source code.

167. Release Credentials

Release credentials must be provided by CI/CD secret management.

168. Configuration and Supply Chain

Third-party libraries must not receive application secrets merely because they are dependencies.

Only the components requiring credentials should receive them.

169. Plugin Configuration

Plugins are untrusted extensions unless explicitly trusted.

A plugin should not automatically receive all configuration.

170. Plugin Capability Model

Plugins should receive capability-scoped configuration.

For example:

plugin -> specific API credential

rather than:

plugin -> entire application environment
171. Dynamic Imports

Configuration must not directly enable arbitrary Python imports from untrusted input.

172. Unsafe Deserialization

Configuration parsing must avoid unsafe deserialization formats where possible.

Untrusted configuration must not be loaded through mechanisms capable of arbitrary code execution.

173. YAML Configuration

If YAML configuration is supported, safe parsing must be mandatory.

Unsafe YAML loaders must not be used on untrusted input.

174. Pickle

Pickle must not be used as a configuration transport for untrusted data.

175. JSON Configuration

JSON is preferred for interoperable structured configuration where structured files are required.

Schema validation remains mandatory.

176. TOML Configuration

TOML may be used for developer-friendly static configuration.

Secret handling rules still apply.

177. Configuration Files

Configuration files must have:

clear ownership;
clear precedence;
explicit schema;
controlled permissions;
documented security classification.
178. Production Configuration Files

Production configuration files containing secrets should be avoided when environment or secret injection is practical.

179. Configuration Encryption

AegisAI does not require encrypted configuration files for the MVP.

Encrypted configuration may be supported later when a justified deployment requirement exists.

Encryption does not remove the need for access control and key management.

180. Secret Manager Integration

AegisAI should keep the configuration abstraction flexible enough to integrate with open-source secret managers later.

Potential implementations may include:

Vault-compatible systems;
container secrets;
Kubernetes secrets;
operating-system secret stores.

The core application must not depend on a proprietary provider.

181. Secret Manager Boundary

External secret managers are separate trust boundaries.

Credentials used to access a secret manager must themselves be protected.

182. Secret Manager Failure

If required secrets cannot be retrieved, security-sensitive services should fail closed.

They must not silently substitute insecure defaults.

183. Optional Secret Sources

Optional integrations may remain disabled when credentials are unavailable.

The application should distinguish:

optional capability unavailable

from:

required security configuration missing
184. Required vs Optional Configuration

Every configuration field should be classified as:

required;
optional;
conditional.

Conditional configuration becomes required when a feature is enabled.

185. Conditional Validation

Example:

TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true

may require:

TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT

If the dependency is missing, startup or feature activation must fail clearly.

186. Feature Dependency Graph

Configuration dependencies should be explicit.

Conceptually:

Feature A
  |
  +--> requires B
  |
  +--> requires secret C

This prevents partial feature activation.

187. Configuration Errors

Configuration errors should have stable categories.

Examples:

CONFIG_MISSING
CONFIG_INVALID
CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED
CONFIG_CONFLICT
CONFIG_SECRET_UNAVAILABLE
CONFIG_SECURITY_VIOLATION
188. Error Messages

Errors should be useful without exposing sensitive values.

They should identify:

configuration key;
error category;
remediation guidance.

Sensitive values must remain redacted.

189. Configuration Metrics

Metrics may count:

configuration_validation_failures

but should not contain configuration values.

190. Configuration Audit Events

Recommended events include:

configuration.created
configuration.updated
configuration.deleted
configuration.validation_failed
secret.rotated
secret.revoked
191. Audit Event Fields

Safe fields include:

event_id
timestamp
actor_id
scope
configuration_key
operation
result
request_id

Secret values must be excluded.

192. Configuration Security Events

Suspicious configuration activity may produce security events.

Examples:

repeated invalid configuration changes;
unauthorized secret access;
attempts to weaken security floors;
attempts to expose protected configuration.
193. Rate Limiting Configuration Changes

Administrative configuration endpoints should be protected against abuse.

Rate limiting may be applied where appropriate.

194. Reauthentication

Highly sensitive operations may require reauthentication.

Examples:

signing key rotation;
authentication policy changes;
administrator credential changes.
195. Approval Workflows

Future deployments may require multi-person approval for highly sensitive configuration changes.

This is outside the MVP but compatible with the architecture.

196. Configuration Export

Exporting configuration must default to safe metadata only.

Full secret export is prohibited through normal application APIs.

197. Configuration Backup

Backups may contain configuration data.

Backup systems must therefore treat configuration backups as potentially sensitive.

198. Backup Encryption

Production backups containing sensitive configuration should use appropriate encryption and access controls.

199. Backup Restoration

Restoration procedures must preserve secret isolation.

Restoring a database must not unexpectedly restore obsolete production credentials into a new environment.

200. Environment Promotion

Configuration promotion from development to staging to production should not copy secrets blindly.

Only configuration structure and approved values should be promoted.

Production secrets must be independently injected.

201. Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure configuration may be stored in source control when safe.

Secret values must be supplied separately.

202. Terraform and Similar Tools

If infrastructure-as-code tools are introduced, state files must be treated as potentially sensitive.

AegisAI deployment documentation must warn operators accordingly.

203. Kubernetes

If Kubernetes deployment is introduced, Kubernetes Secret objects may be used, but RBAC and cluster security remain mandatory.

Secrets should not be placed into ConfigMaps.

204. Helm

Helm values files must not contain production secrets in tracked repositories.

205. Docker Compose Development

Local Compose configuration should support:

.env

for developer values while keeping secrets outside version control.

206. Compose Production

Production Compose deployment should use externally supplied secrets or environment injection rather than repository-managed plaintext credentials.

207. Environment Naming

Environment identifiers must be explicit.

Recommended values:

development
test
staging
production

Unknown values should be rejected.

208. Development Security Exceptions

Development-only security exceptions must be explicit.

Example:

ALLOW_INSECURE_DEV_MODE=true

should never silently apply in production.

209. Production Security Enforcement

Production mode should reject development-only bypass settings.

210. Test Security Enforcement

Tests should verify that:

development-only bypass

cannot activate under:

production
211. Configuration Drift

Operational environments may drift from documented configuration.

AegisAI should expose safe configuration fingerprints or schema versions to assist detection.

212. Configuration Fingerprint Design

Fingerprints must be:

non-secret;
deterministic where useful;
resistant to trivial secret recovery;
safe to expose to authorized operators.
213. Configuration Compatibility

Application upgrades should verify configuration compatibility before migration.

214. Deployment Gate

Production deployment should fail if required configuration validation fails.

215. Health Gate

Deployment automation should verify readiness after configuration injection.

216. Secret Availability Check

A deployment should verify that required secrets are available without printing their values.

217. Secret Presence vs Value

Safe diagnostic output may say:

MODEL_API_KEY configured: yes

but not:

MODEL_API_KEY: sk-actual-secret
218. Configuration Logging

Startup logs may report safe configuration metadata.

Example:

environment=production
log_level=INFO
model_provider=ollama

They must not dump the configuration object.

219. Startup Secret Redaction

Startup validation errors must use redacted representations.

220. Configuration Snapshot

If configuration snapshots are required for debugging, they must be explicitly redacted and access-controlled.

221. Snapshot Storage

Configuration snapshots must not be stored in:

public object storage;
Git repositories;
frontend assets;
ordinary logs.
222. Configuration Snapshot Retention

Snapshots should have explicit retention and deletion policies.

223. Configuration in Crash Reports

Crash reporting must redact configuration before transmission.

224. Configuration in Support Bundles

Support bundles must contain only safe diagnostic information.

They must not automatically include .env.

225. Configuration in Bug Reports

Automated bug-report tooling must avoid attaching environment dumps.

226. Configuration in Screenshots

Documentation and issue reports should avoid screenshots containing credentials.

227. Security Review

Changes to configuration handling should receive security review when they affect:

secrets;
authentication;
authorization;
network policy;
code execution;
filesystem access;
data retention;
telemetry.
228. Code Review Requirements

Reviewers should ask:

Is this configuration sensitive?
Can it contain secrets?
Is it validated?
Is the default secure?
Can it reach the frontend?
Can it reach logs?
Can it reach telemetry?
Can it reach evidence?
Can lower scopes weaken it?
Is authorization required?
229. Threat Model Alignment

Configuration threats identified in the threat model include:

credential exposure;
configuration tampering;
privilege escalation;
unsafe defaults;
secret leakage;
SSRF policy bypass;
command execution enablement;
plugin abuse;
insecure deployment.

The implementation must maintain controls against these threats.

294. Configuration Threat: Certificate Validation

Threat:

295. TLS Configuration

TLS configuration should explicitly define:

certificate verification;
trusted authorities;
minimum protocol requirements;
hostname verification.
296. Insecure TLS

Disabling certificate verification should be considered a development-only exception.

Production must reject insecure TLS configuration unless an explicitly documented security exception exists.

297. HTTP Configuration

Plain HTTP should not be used for sensitive production communication unless the deployment architecture explicitly provides equivalent protected transport.

298. Proxy Credentials

Proxy credentials are secrets and must follow the same redaction and rotation rules.

299. External API Configuration

External APIs should have:

explicit endpoint;
authentication method;
timeout;
retry policy;
rate limit;
data-sharing policy.
300. Data-Sharing Configuration

AegisAI should make external data transfer explicit.

A configuration option should not silently permit sensitive assessment data to leave the deployment.

301. External Evaluator Configuration

External evaluators must be treated as separate trust boundaries.

Configuration should explicitly identify:

external evaluation enabled

and the destination.

302. Local-First Evaluation

Where practical, AegisAI should prefer local/open-source evaluators for privacy-sensitive workflows.

303. External Model Credentials

Credentials for external evaluators must be isolated from target model credentials.

304. Data Minimization

Only necessary data should be sent to external services.

Configuration must not disable privacy minimization globally without explicit authorization.

305. Configuration and Compliance

Configuration metadata may support compliance evidence.

However, configuration state must not automatically be interpreted as proof of compliance.

306. Legal Classification

AegisAI configuration does not automatically determine legal or regulatory compliance.

Compliance mappings should remain explicit.

307. Configuration and Risk

Configuration changes may affect risk scoring.

For example:

external telemetry enabled

may change privacy exposure.

Risk engines should consume validated security signals rather than raw secrets.

308. Configuration and Findings

Configuration-related security weaknesses may generate findings.

Examples:

insecure TLS;
debug enabled in production;
unrestricted network;
missing authentication configuration.
309. Configuration Finding Evidence

Findings should contain safe evidence.

Secret values must be redacted.

310. Configuration Finding Reproduction

Reproduction instructions must use placeholders rather than actual credentials.

311. Configuration Finding Remediation

Recommendations should identify the configuration control without exposing secret values.

312. Configuration Regression

Fixed configuration vulnerabilities should become regression tests.

313. Secure Configuration Baseline

AegisAI should maintain a secure baseline configuration for supported deployment modes.

314. Baseline Validation

Baseline validation should verify:

authentication;
authorization;
TLS;
network restrictions;
logging redaction;
secret handling;
debug state;
resource limits.
315. Configuration Profiles

AegisAI may define profiles such as:

development
secure-development
test
staging
production

Profiles must be explicit.

316. Production Profile

The production profile should enable the strongest practical security defaults.

317. Test Profile

The test profile should maximize determinism while preserving security boundaries.

318. Development Profile

The development profile may optimize usability but must not teach production-incompatible security patterns.

319. Staging Profile

Staging should approximate production security behavior.

320. Configuration Profiles and Secrets

Profiles should not contain real secret values.

They define behavior and validation requirements.

321. Configuration Templates

Templates should contain placeholders only.

322. Template Validation

CI should validate that templates do not contain obvious real credentials.

323. Example Secret Detection

A documented example should use values such as:

CHANGE_ME
YOUR_SECRET_HERE
example-only
324. Secret Entropy

High-entropy strings in tracked files should be considered potential credentials during secret scanning.

325. False Positive Handling

Secret scanning exceptions should be:

narrow;
documented;
reviewed;
non-global.
326. Secret Scanning Scope

Scanning should cover:

source;
documentation;
configuration;
Docker files;
CI workflows;
test fixtures;
scripts.
327. Generated Files

Generated artifacts must also be considered for secret leakage.

328. Build Artifacts

Recommended workflow:

copy .env.example -> .env
fill local values
run validation
start application
run tests
362. Development Validation Command

The project should eventually provide a command similar to:

aegis config validate

to validate local configuration without starting the full application.

363. Production Validation Command

Deployment systems should support a non-secret diagnostic such as:

aegis config validate --environment production

without printing secret values.

364. Configuration Health Command

A future command may report:

configuration valid
database configured

553. Redaction Sources

Redaction should consider:

known secret values;
sensitive field names;
authorization headers;
cookies;
credential-bearing URLs;
private keys.
554. Redaction Limits

Redaction systems must avoid accidentally logging raw data before the sanitizer executes.

555. Structured Logging

Examples:

AuthSettings -> authentication maintainers
DatabaseSettings -> backend maintainers
ModelSettings -> model integration maintainers
SecuritySettings -> security maintainers
588. Configuration Reviewers

Changes to secret handling should require review by maintainers familiar with security boundaries.

589. Configuration Documentation Ownership

Documentation must remain synchronized with implementation.

590. Configuration Inventory

The project should maintain an inventory of configuration keys.

591. Secret Inventory

Secrets should be inventoried by purpose and scope without storing their values.

name
purpose
owner
scope
source

source=environment
source=secret-manager
source=default
source=database
602. Secret Provenance

Secret provenance may identify the source type without revealing the value.

603. Configuration Source Trust

Configuration sources have different trust levels.

Deployment-provided secrets should be treated as trusted inputs only after validation.

If configuration is stored in PostgreSQL, it should use typed fields or structured validated data rather than arbitrary unvalidated blobs for security-sensitive settings.

619. JSON Configuration in Database

JSON may be used for flexible non-security-sensitive metadata.

Security-sensitive values still require schema and access controls.

620. Database Secret Encryption

If persistent secret storage is implemented, encryption keys must be stored separately from the database.

621. Key Separation

The database containing encrypted credentials must not be sufficient by itself to decrypt those credentials.

622. Encryption Key Rotation

Persistent secret encryption should support key rotation where implemented.

623. Encrypted Secret Backup

Encrypted secrets remain sensitive even when encrypted.

Backup access controls remain mandatory.

624. Secret Decryption Boundary

Only the component requiring the secret should decrypt it.

625. Secret Decryption Audit

Revoked credentials must stop being selected across workers within an acceptable operational window.

631. Configuration Synchronization

Future distributed configuration systems must preserve transactionality and authorization.

632. Configuration Race

Concurrent secret rotation and job execution must have defined semantics.

633. Job Credential Binding

Jobs should bind credentials to the target and authorization context at execution time.

894. Alternatives Considered
Alternative A: Hard-coded configuration

Rejected.

Reasons:

insecure;
inflexible;
impossible to operate safely across environments.
Alternative B: .env as production secret store

Rejected.

Reasons:

weak operational controls;
easy accidental disclosure;
poor rotation model.
Alternative C: Store all configuration in PostgreSQL

Rejected as the primary source.

Reasons:

bootstrap dependency;
secret exposure risk;
difficult early startup;
unnecessary coupling.

Database-backed configuration may be added selectively.

Alternative D: Proprietary cloud secret manager only

Rejected for the core architecture.

Reasons:

violates open-source/portable goals;
creates unnecessary provider lock-in;
harms local development.

Integrations remain possible.

Alternative E: Custom cryptographic secret system

Rejected.

Reasons:

unnecessary complexity;
high risk of implementation mistakes;
mature libraries already exist.
Alternative F: Arbitrary runtime environment access

Rejected.

Reasons:

configuration sprawl;
inconsistent validation;
poor testability;
increased secret exposure.
895. Consequences
Positive

This architecture provides:

predictable configuration;
stronger secret isolation;
secure defaults;
environment portability;
easier testing;
better operational debugging;
safer open-source development;
better CI/CD integration;
reduced accidental credential leakage;
clearer security boundaries.
Negative

It introduces:

configuration schema complexity;
additional validation code;
secret-management procedures;
deployment documentation requirements;
more testing;
operational discipline.

These costs are intentional.

896. Security Philosophy

AegisAI must assume that configuration is a powerful control plane.

Configuration can enable or disable major capabilities.

Therefore configuration must not be treated as harmless metadata.

The application must distinguish:

configuration as data

from:

configuration as authority

and protect the latter accordingly.

897. Final Security Principle

AegisAI must never create a security vulnerability merely because configuration is convenient.

In particular:

AegisAI must never require secrets to live in source code, and no component may receive more configuration authority or secret material than it requires.

898. Final Decision

The AegisAI configuration architecture is therefore:

                ┌───────────────────────────┐
                │ Safe Defaults / Schema    │
                └─────────────┬─────────────┘

      ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
      │ Application / API / Workers / Adapters     │
      └────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Security boundaries remain authoritative regardless of configuration.

Configuration cannot override authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, privacy controls, network restrictions, evidence protection, or other mandatory security controls.

899. Implementation Gate

No production implementation should begin from this ADR until:

the configuration schema is reviewed;
secret classifications are defined;
